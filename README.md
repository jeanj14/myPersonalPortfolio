<h1>Capstone Project 2</h1>
A personal site I made with pure HTML and CSS. I designed the website using Canva, with a custom color palette tailored to the website's aesthetic.

After I was done designing the website on Canva, I published the design as a mock website. This mock website, I used in order to layout all the elements on the page. 

I made the website from the ground up with HTML and CSS. It took a lot of effort. The website is now 100% responsive for Mobile and Desktop. I deployed the website using Netflify in conjunction with my GitHub repo.
